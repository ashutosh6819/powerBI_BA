    "Q2. Explain Web Front End(WFE) cluster from Power BI Service Architecture?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Answer - The Power BI service architecture is based on two clusters â€“ the Web Front End (WFE) cluster and the Back-End cluster. The WFE cluster manages the initial connection and authentication to the Power BI service, and once authenticated, the Back-End handles all subsequent user interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Explain Back End cluster from Power BI Service Architecture?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Answer - The Back-End cluster is how authenticated clients interact with the Power BI service. The Back-End cluster manages visualizations, user dashboards, datasets, reports, data storage, data connections, data refresh, and other aspects of interacting with the Power BI service\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. What ASP.NET component does in Power BI Service Architecture?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Answer - The ASP.NET component within the WFE cluster parses the token to determine which organization the user belongs to, and then consults the Power BI Global Service. The WFE specifies to the browser which back-end cluster houses the organization's tenant.\n",

    "\n",
    "    Answer - Data import - Power BI has faster processing than Excel. Power BI dashboards are more visually appealing, interactive and customizable than those in Excel.\n",
    "    \n",
    "        Data transformation - Power BI and Excel differ when it comes to which data sources they can work with. Excel can connect to many sources. Power BI, however, supports many more data sources.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        Modeling -  Power BI is a more powerful tool than Excel in terms of comparison between tables, reports or data files. Power BI is more user friendly and easy to use than Excel.\n",
